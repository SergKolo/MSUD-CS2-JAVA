    The control flow of the main method is fairly straightforward.
    As required in the  point #3 of the assignment, the program
    starts with first phase, where user manually enters names, until
    they enters "nextphase" in order to go to phase 2.
    Phase 2 is where the user is prompted to enter file or path to file
    that will be analyzed.

    As stated in the requirements, the driver class merely creates
    the object, and the driver then calls getSoundex method in
    both cases.
